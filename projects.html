        As a university team captain for the SAE Supra competition, I led the
        design and manufacturing of our vehicle's suspension system, aiming to
        meet stringent standards while optimizing weight and cost. This project
        exemplifies my proficiency in engineering design, kinematic analysis,
        and manufacturing processes.<br /><br />
        <strong>Redesign:</strong> In response to the demanding requirements of
        the SAE Supra competition, I spearheaded a comprehensive redesign of our
        vehicle's suspension system. The key achievements in this endeavor
        include:<br />

        <strong>Weight Reduction:</strong> By implementing an updated design, we
        successfully reduced the weight of the suspension assembly by an
        impressive 6 kg, enhancing the overall vehicle performance.<br />

        <strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Through careful design and material
        selection, we managed to trim down the manufacturing cost by $900, a
        substantial achievement that contributed to our project's overall
        success.<br /><br />

        <strong>Design Approach:</strong> Informed by the need for a high-speed
        vehicle, we opted for a double-wishbone suspension system. The following
        steps summarize's design process:<br />

        <strong>Parameters Determination:</strong> Meticulously defined
        essential parameters such as wheelbase, track width, kingpin, and caster
        to tailor our suspension to the competition's requirements.<br />

        <strong>Hardpoint Specification:</strong> Our choice of an unequal
        length double wishbone suspension enabled greater flexibility in camber
        adjustment, vital for optimal performance.<br />

        <strong>Kinematic Analysis:</strong> Utilized Solidworks and LOTUS Shark
        for kinematic analysis, ensuring the suspension system's wheel travels
        aligned with damper positions during jounce and rebound. These findings
        were later incorporated into dynamic analyses to establish travel
        limitations.<br /><br />

        This study explores the impact of nanoparticles on composites, enhancing
        properties such as mechanical strength, toughness, and electrical
        conductivity. Using Kevlar fiber, Araldite LY 556 resin, and Aradur HY
        951 hardener, four specimens with varying graphene nano-filler
        percentages (0%, 1%, 3%, and 5%) were created. The project evaluates
        property changes in composites as nano-filler content increases, with
        the unfilled laminate as the baseline.
        <br />
        <strong>Impact Strength Test:</strong>
        Impact strength is a crucial mechanical property for engineering
        materials. Both Izod and Charpy methods are employed to conduct impact
        tests on areca fiber-reinforced epoxy composites, following ASTM-D256-90
        standards.
        <br />
        <strong>Izod Impact Test:</strong>
        The Izod impact test measures a material's resistance to impact from a
        swinging pendulum. It quantifies the kinetic energy required to initiate
        and continue fracture until the specimen breaks. Notched Izod impact
        tests involve notching specimens to prevent deformation upon impact.
        This test serves as a quick quality check and allows material
        comparisons for toughness.

        <strong>Electrical Conductivity:</strong>
        Electrical resistivity, denoted by the symbol "ρ," quantifies a
        material's resistance to electrical flow, with units in ohm·metres (Ω
        m). Low resistivity indicates easy electrical flow, while high
        resistivity signifies difficulty in conducting electricity. Copper and
        aluminium, with very low resistivities (around 20 nΩ m), are commonly
        used in electrical wires for efficient power transmission. In contrast,
        high-resistivity materials like certain plastics (with resistivities as
        high as 1 EΩ m or 1 × 10^18 Ω m) impede electric power flow.

        <strong>Test Procedure:</strong>
        A constant current source directs a current (I) through the sample bar,
        while a separate ammeter measures I. Simultaneously, a voltmeter
        measures the voltage (V) generated across the inner part of the bar.
        Alternatively, a voltage source can be used to apply voltage across
        outer contacts, with an ammeter in series measuring current through the
        sample bar.

        <strong>Results:</strong>
        The addition of graphene to the composite resulted in an enhancement of
        electrical conductivity. However, while there was improvement in
        comparison to graphene-free laminates, the degree of improvement
        remained relatively minor as the percentage of graphene varied.

        <strong>Testing Procedure:</strong>
        In accordance with ASTM standards, Mode I fracture toughness testing is
        conducted using ASTM D5528. This test assesses the opening interlaminar
        fracture toughness of continuous fiber-reinforced composite materials.
        It employs a double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen with a nonadhesive
        film at the midplane to initiate delamination. The test evaluates a
        material's susceptibility to delamination and helps establish design
        parameters for composite structures, considering factors such as strain
        energy release rate and load application (opening or tensile load per
        Mode I).
        <br />
        <strong>Results:</strong>
        We found that fracture toughness increased with the addition of
        nano-filler up to a 1% volume fraction of graphene. However, beyond this
        point, a decrease in fracture toughness was observed.

        <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
        This project has revealed important insights into the performance of
        Kevlar-reinforced composites with the addition of graphene nano-fillers.
        Specifically, we observed that the impact strength of these composites
        increased as we introduced graphene nano-fillers up to a 3% weight
        ratio. However, beyond this threshold, the impact strength experienced a
        decline, likely attributed to the formation of agglomerations resulting
        from the high specific volume of graphene.
        <br />
        Additionally, the incorporation of graphene led to an improvement in
        electrical conductivity within the laminates. Nevertheless, further
        increasing the percentage of graphene did not yield significant
        improvements.
        <br />
        In terms of fracture toughness, our findings showed an increase when
        nano-fillers were added up to a 1% volume fraction of graphene.
        Subsequently, a decline in fracture toughness was observed after
        reaching this 1% threshold.
        <br />
        Considering these observations, it can be concluded that an optimal
        balance is achieved at a 3% volume fraction of graphene for these
        composite materials.

        <strong>Composite Materials Overview:</strong>
        Composite materials result from the combination of dissimilar materials
        to create specialized composites with enhanced properties such as
        mechanical strength, toughness, and electrical characteristics, not
        achievable with individual constituents.
        <br />
        <strong>Project Objectives:</strong>
        This project focuses on assessing the impact of SiC particles on
        mechanical properties (tensile and flexural strength) and conducting
        Thermogravimetric analysis to measure composite weight loss at various
        temperatures.
        <br />
        <strong>Methodology:</strong>
        We prepared basalt fibre-reinforced polymer (BFRP) composites with an
        epoxy matrix, consisting of four layers of fiber, using a hand lay-up
        compression molding method.

        were generated directly from the machine for both basalt composites, one
        without silicon carbide filler and the other with silicon carbide
        filler. The outcomes reveal that the tensile strength of the composite
        with silicon carbide surpasses that of the composite without silicon

            In our study of basalt fiber-reinforced epoxy resin composites, we

            characteristics.
          </li>
          <li>
            We observed that increasing the silicon carbide content enhanced
            both flexural modulus and strength. The composite with 8% silicon
            carbide exhibited notable flexural strength, reaching 240.27 MPa,
            likely due to effective void filling by SiC particles.
          </li>
          <li>
            The tensile strength was robust, measuring up to 318 N/mm² in some
            samples, but it decreased as silicon carbide content increased. This
            decrease is attributed to increased brittleness induced by higher
            SiC percentages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thermogravimetric analysis revealed no decomposition up to 270°C in
            all specimens, and as SiC composition increased, weight loss
            decreased, primarily due to silicon carbide's thermal properties.

            These findings shed light on the performance of these composite
            materials, indicating their potential for various applications while
